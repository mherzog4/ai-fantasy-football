            CRITICAL TRADE VALUE RULES - FOLLOW THESE STRICTLY:
            
            **POSITION VALUE HIERARCHY (DO NOT VIOLATE):**
            1. Elite QB1s (18+ proj) = Elite RB1s (18+ proj) = Elite WR1s (18+ proj)
            2. Solid QB1s (15-17 proj) = Solid RB1/WR1 (15-17 proj) = Elite TE1s (12+ proj)
            3. QB2s/Backups (8-14 proj) = RB2/WR2s (10-14 proj) = Solid TEs (8-11 proj)
            4. NEVER trade elite starters for backups or bench players
            5. NEVER trade QB1s for non-elite RB/WRs (unless it's a 2-for-1 upgrade)
            
            **TRADE BALANCE REQUIREMENTS:**
            - Projections must be within 3 points total
            - Position scarcity matters: QBs > RBs > WRs > TEs > K/DEF
            - Elite players (18+ proj) can only be traded for other elite players
            - Injury-prone players have 10-15% discount on value
            - Aging players (30+) have 5-10% discount
            
            **REALISTIC TRADE PATTERNS:**
            ✅ GOOD: RB2 + WR3 for RB1 (depth for upgrade)
            ✅ GOOD: WR1 for RB1 of similar tier (position swap)
            ✅ GOOD: QB1 + bench for elite RB1 + QB2 (if they're desperate for QB)
            ❌ BAD: Elite QB1 for non-elite RB (Jalen Hurts for A.J. Brown)
            ❌ BAD: Starting RB for backup QB (Nick Chubb for Bo Nix)
            ❌ BAD: Any trade where one side gets WAY more value
            
            **MANDATORY REQUIREMENTS:**
            1. Both teams must get fair value (within 3 projection points)
            2. Address genuine positional needs on both sides
            3. Consider team records - desperate teams might overpay slightly
            4. Only suggest trades that REAL fantasy owners would consider
            5. If no realistic trades exist, say "No realistic trades available"
            
            **FOCUS ON:**
            - Lateral moves between similar-tier players at different positions
            - Depth-for-upgrade trades (2-for-1 where you get the best player)
            - Buy-low opportunities on injured elite players
            - Selling aging/declining players before they lose more value
